A formal representation of a Sumerian Grammar
----------------------------------------------

The principle characteristic of sumerian text is that it is, unlike most
known languages, a agglutinating language, that is the words of the
vocabulary are unchangeable and their variations (for example to change
a name from singular to plural) do not modified the word directly as
happens in English (Dog ? Dogs), but add a particle (suffissex,
prefixes) or repeat a word (lugal =Â the king ? lugal-lugal = the kings).
This characteristic makes it particularly suitable for the construction
of an ontology of the grammar because it is (at least at the current
state of knowledge) very much poorer and much more formal than most
other languages.

The work carried out demonstrates how its possible to apply the
technologies of the Semantic Web also to a natural language. The grammar
expressed in this ontology is only partial, however the road taken seems
to be the correct one and if revised and integrated this ontology would
definitely represent a new and important instrument to study
Assyriology.

The choice sumerian text
------------------------

The chois fell on the text of Ur-Namma tablet. The text commemorating
the building of a temple dedicated to Nanna (the great ziggurat at Ur).
It also announces the building of a defensive wall for the city.
